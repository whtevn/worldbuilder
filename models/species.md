# species and world generation

1. generate the materials in the world
2. establish the amounts of materials in the world
3. generate species based on the materials generated
    - establish edible materials
    - establish poisonous materials
    - establish waste from edibles
4. generate sizes of individuals and populations based on amounts of materials
   and their status os edible, poisonous, or inorganic

# position

information regarding the size, coordinates, and direction of an individual

# nutrition profile

information regarding the requirements for nutrition, parameters on growth,
tolerances for poison and waste

# nutrition requirements

# map

not accurate. depends on individual's sight and memory ability.
the map of an individual is the map that they believe exists,
rather than the map that actually exists. They can attempt things
such as walking into walls that will not work. they may believe
there is no wall there, but if the wall exists their attempt will
be thwarted. Ideally an individual's sensory capacity will lead them
to good decisions, but there is no requirement for that


# reproduction

a species attributes are all organized in a specific (yet to be
determined) way. all individuals of all species can have their
attributes reduced into a set of encoded attributes. If the
types of attributes match up, then those species can reproduce

# species vs individual

the species determines the ranges on various attributes, the
order of their sequencing for reproductive purposes, base actions
and knowledge. an individual is an instance of a species that
is created within the tolerances of that species.

the models for individuals and species are very similar, but
are probably not identical. Example models to come for clarification.
