# GOAL

create a world and simulate a history. tell the story from the perspective
of an individual, institution, or world

# PHASES

## Definition

create the institutions, characters, materials, and other data that will
define the world. This does not disperse the items throughout the map,
but instead serves as the DNA for the seeding process

## Seeding

Create a map, disperse moisture, materials and institutions throughout
the map. Initialize civlizations and communities

## Simulation

entities move via their own motivation through time. The state of the world
throughout each moment in time is calculated and recorded. All entities move
foward with their knowledge of the world from previous moments and their
current needs.

## Story

the moments produced by the simulation are then inspected and reduced based
on a perspective to detail the events that took place
